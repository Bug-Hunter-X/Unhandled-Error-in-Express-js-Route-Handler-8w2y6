This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js route handlers: the lack of proper error handling. The `bug.js` file shows a route that attempts to find a user by ID but fails to handle cases where the ID is invalid or the user is not found.  The `bugSolution.js` file provides a corrected version with comprehensive error handling.
